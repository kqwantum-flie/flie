        USAGE

          flie - flie on aos with aro.

        SYNOPSIS
          flie is the web interface that:
            a) you are typing into right now.
            b) is running on aos

          flie and aos are separate processes. flie allows you to
          talk directly to aos through a web-safe command proxy.
          many users may operate in the same aos space via flie.
